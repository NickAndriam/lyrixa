  "lyric": "Underneath the moonlit sky\nWhere the stars begin to shine\nI'll sing a serenade for you\nMy love, forever thine\n\nThrough the whispers of the wind\nAnd the rustling leaves in the night\nI'll croon a melody so sweet\nIn the pale and silvery light\n\nAs we dance among the dreams\nIn the meadows soft and wide\nMy heart's serenade will play\nAs we twirl side by side\n\nWith your hand in mine, we'll sway\nTo the music of the night\nOur love's song, a timeless tune\nIn the soft and gentle moonlight\n\nChorus:\nSerenade of the stars, oh so bright\nIn your arms, I find my light\nIn this serenade of love tonight\n\nThrough the highs and through the lows\nIn the journey that we share\nI'll sing this serenade for you\nWith a love beyond compare\n\nThrough the stormy nights we face\nAnd the battles that we fight\nI'll serenade you through it all\nWith a love that's burning bright\n\nAs we build our dreams so high\nAnd our spirits take their flight\nThis serenade will be our song\nAs we reach new heights\n\nWith your heart and soul entwined\nIn this love that feels so right\nTogether we'll embrace the world\nIn the serenade of our life\n\nChorus:\nSerenade of the stars, oh so bright\nIn your arms, I find my light\nIn this serenade of love tonight\n\nBridge:\nIn every moment, in every day\nIn this serenade, our love will stay\nWith you, I've found my way\nTogether, forever, we'll never sway\n\nChorus:\nSerenade of the stars, oh so bright\nIn your arms, I find my light\nIn this serenade of love tonight\n\nOutro:\nUnderneath the moonlit sky\nWhere the stars begin to shine\nI'll sing a serenade for you\nMy love, forever thine"
